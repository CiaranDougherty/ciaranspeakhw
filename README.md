Apologies, as you can see from the commit dates, I didn't actually get this started until Sunday, and I had to learn how to do all the package management stuff, too.

If you're willing to let me get back to this at some point, I'd love to finish it, but right now I need to try to deal with the shingles on my roof that came off in the windstorm this weekend.


Hopefully it is a sufficient example of my coding style, design processes, etc.
